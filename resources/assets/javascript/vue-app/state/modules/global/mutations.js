// Only mutations can change state of module.
// They should be synchronous (never returns promise), 
// not contain any logic (be extremely fast) except one needed to keep state as it should be (for example sets default value for state). 
// Mutations should be invoked only by actions from the same module. 
// In most cases it should be only a single action which invokes specific mutation.

// Types of mutation:
// SET_ - itâ€™s the most common type of mutation. It can set an object (or whole array), set default value of object (or maybe clean array),
// ADD_ - it can add new element to state property which is an array or add new element to Map
// REMOVE_ - an opposite to ADD. It can remove map element or array element by index (or by finding object which is not recommended way on big arrays, then mutation could be slow)
